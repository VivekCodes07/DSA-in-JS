# DSA with JavaScript

This repo is my journey learning **Data Structures & Algorithms** using JavaScript, following this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbtI3_MArDOmSKABu09sEs0SxCibd1wgr).  

It’s mostly practice code, small exercises, and notes as I go along.

## Why this repo?

- To actually **code** what I learn, not just watch tutorials  
- Keep track of my progress  
- Have a place to revisit my notes and solutions

## Current Status

## Topics (so far / planned)

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues
